      question: "What if I can't get an appointment in time?",
      answer: "By law, you must register within 3 working days of arrival if you're a third-country national planning to stay longer than 30 days. If you cannot get an appointment, it's advised to visit the office and explain the situation to avoid potential fines. EU citizens have 30 days."

      question: "Can I pay the fee with a card?",
      answer: "It depends on the office. Many smaller offices only accept fee stamps ('{glossary:kolky}'), which can be purchased at any post office. It's safer to have the stamps ready beforehand."
