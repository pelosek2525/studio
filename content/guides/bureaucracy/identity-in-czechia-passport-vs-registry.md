When you receive a Czech registry document (*matriční doklad*), such as a marriage or birth certificate, your name may be transcribed into a Czech version. This "registry identity" can often differ from the name in your passport, especially if your name is transcribed from a non-Latin script.

For example:
*   **Name in Cyrillic:** В’ячеслав Шишка
*   **International passport transcription:** Vyacheslav Shyshka
*   **Czech transcription:** Vjačeslav Šyška

By law, the registry identity takes precedence over the passport identity in the Czech national Register of Inhabitants. This means that after your Czech registry document is processed by the Ministry of the Interior, you will be automatically listed in the official register under the name written on that document, regardless of the name in your passport.

However, your residence permit card will always be issued in the name that appears in your passport, as it must match your travel document for border control purposes.

This creates a practical discrepancy where the name on your residence permit and passport differs from the name in the national register. When dealing with authorities (like the tax office, trade license office, or social security), it is highly recommended to inform them of this difference upfront to avoid confusion.

### What should you do?

*   If you have a biometric residence card or a permanent residence permit, you can request to have your registry identity added as an official note on the card.
*   It's a good practice to carry a certified copy of your Czech registry document (e.g., marriage certificate) to prove your identity when the names don't match. You will need this to prove the connection between your passport name and your registry name.
