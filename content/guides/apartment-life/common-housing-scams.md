One of the most common scams involves a fake landlord asking for a deposit before you've even seen the apartment. They might ask for {currency:10000:CZK} to "reserve" the flat. Always be suspicious of such requests.

Another common scam is related to utility overcharging. Make sure you have a clear agreement on how utilities are paid. Sometimes landlords invent fees, like a {currency:500:CZK} "staircase cleaning" fee that doesn't exist.
