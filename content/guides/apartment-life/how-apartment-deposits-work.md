*The apartment deposit* ({glossary:kauce}) is a crucial part of renting in Czechia. It serves as a financial safeguard for landlords against potential damages or unpaid rent. Typically, the deposit amounts to one to three months' rent, and the maximum is legally limited to three months' rent. Landlords must inform tenants about how the deposit will be stored and under what conditions it will be returned. The deposit should be kept in a separate account, not mixed with the landlord's personal funds. Upon moving out, landlords are required to return the deposit within 30 days, provided all conditions are met. Deductions can only be made for damages beyond normal wear and tear or for outstanding rent and utility bills. Landlords must provide an itemized list of deductions if the full amount is not returned.
