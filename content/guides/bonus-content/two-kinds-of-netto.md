If you've spent any time in the Czech Republic, you've likely come across the Albert grocery store chain. But you might have noticed that they come in two distinct flavors: the smaller blue "Albert Supermarket" and the larger orange "Albert Hypermarket". While they share a name, they serve different shopping needs.

### Albert Supermarket (The blue one)

Think of this as your standard neighborhood grocery store. 

*   **Size & Location:** These are smaller stores, typically found in city centers, residential areas, and metro stations. Their convenient locations make them ideal for quick, daily shopping trips.
*   **Product Range:** They offer a focused selection of everyday groceriesâ€”fresh produce, baked goods, dairy, meat, and pantry staples. The variety is sufficient for day-to-day needs, but you won't find a massive selection of specialized or non-food items.

### Albert Hypermarket (The orange one)

This is the "big box" version of Albert, designed for larger, weekly or monthly shopping hauls.

*   **Size & Location:** Hypermarkets are significantly larger, often located in shopping malls or as standalone big-box stores on the outskirts of cities. You'll usually need a car or public transport to get to one.
*   **Product Range:** The selection is vast. In addition to a full-sized supermarket's worth of groceries (often with more brands and options), they also carry a wide array of non-food items. This includes electronics, clothing, toys, home goods, gardening supplies, and more. They are designed to be a one-stop-shop for almost all household needs.

**In short:** Head to an **Albert Supermarket** for your daily bread and milk, and plan a trip to an **Albert Hypermarket** when you need to stock up on everything from groceries to a new pair of socks and a toaster.
