### Steps to Follow

1.  **Book Your Appointment**: Use the official online portal to book a time slot. Appointments fill up fast, so book several weeks in advance. You will receive a confirmation email with your appointment details.
2.  **Prepare Your Documents**: Gather all required documents: your passport, the original signed proof of accommodation (lease agreement or confirmation from the property owner), and a completed application form. Ensure your passport is valid for your intended stay.
3.  **Visit the Office**: Arrive at the designated office at least 15 minutes before your appointment. You will submit your documents, pay the administrative fee, and answer any questions. The official will then issue a confirmation of your registration.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Does the property owner have to sign the confirmation?**

Yes, the proof of accommodation must be signed by the official owner of the property or an authorized representative with a power of attorney.

**What if I can't get an appointment in time?**

By law, you must register within 3 working days of arrival if you're a third-country national planning to stay longer than 30 days. If you cannot get an appointment, it's advised to visit the office and explain the situation to avoid potential fines. EU citizens have 30 days.

**Can I pay the fee with a card?**

It depends on the office. Many smaller offices only accept fee stamps ('{glossary:kolky}'), which can be purchased at any post office. It's safer to have the stamps ready beforehand.
